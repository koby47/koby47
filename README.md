With over 7 years of combined experience in Administration, IT Support, and Cybersecurity, I bring a rare mix of technical expertise and operational excellence to every project.

 My IT journey began in 2006 at a computer hardware repair shop, where I honed hands-on troubleshooting and people skills. Today, I’m focused on **MERN stack development**, **cloud security**, and **DevOps** practices to deliver reliable applications and resilient infrastructure.
